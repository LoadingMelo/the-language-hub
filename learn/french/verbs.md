## Introduction

Verbs in French is where it gets a bit tricky. However, most of them follow a similar formular.

If you recall subject pronuouns:

| Pronoun | Translation         | Pronunciation |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| je      | I                   | zhe           |
| tu      | You (informal)      | to            |
| il      | He                  | ill           |
| elle    | She                 | el            |
| nous    | We                  | nu            |
| vous    | You (formal/plural) | vhu           |
| ils     | They (masculine)    | ill           |
| elles   | They (feminine)     | el            |

Working with verbs makes use of these pronouns

#### The Formula :

The formula is better explained with an example. Let's take the verb **parler** - to speak

1. Remove the ending (er for parler)
2. Add ending relating to subject pronoun

For parler the ending would be -e, -es, -e, -ons , -ez and -ent respectively

- je parl**e**
- tu parl**es**
- il parl**e**
- elle parl**e**
- nous parl**ons**
- vous parl**ez**
- ils parl**ent**
- elles parl**ent**

The next thing to remember is the 3 main groupes of verbes. Their endings will guide most of the conjugation you will do in French.
