## Introduction

> Shona (or ChiShona) is spoken in several countries in Southern Africa and is one of the national languages of Zimbabwe.

Shona is not that difficult to learn as it is pronounced as it is written. It is a respectful language, with a clear way of how you differentiate it.  
In Shona, you are either speaking to someone older (you respect) or someone younger (the same level)

### An example

| Respectful  | Familial    | Translation       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Mhoroi      | Mhoro       | Hello             |
| Makadini    | Wakadini    | How are you?      |
| Maswera sei | Waswera sei | How was your day? |
