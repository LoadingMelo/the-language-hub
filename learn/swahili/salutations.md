#### Habari

- Mostly use **habari** but when addressing one person
- Habari zenu - when addressing more people
- Response to habari (all of them) is **mzuri** or **salama** which is technically fine.

> When you respond you have to know how the other person is doing:  
> **Niko salama labda wewe? (I'm fine how about you)**
