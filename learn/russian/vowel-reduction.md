## Vowel Reduction

Whan we did basics, we said we pronounce exactly what is written, but in phrases that wasn't exactly the case. Let's look at why...

In Russian, there is a concept of stressed and unstressed vowels.

This means that in a word certain vowels are pronounced as is (stressed) and some changed slightly (unstressed)

To start of, Ё (yo) is always stressed.

> Stressed vowels will be shown in **bold** for easier reading.

МОСКВ**А** = maskva = moscow  
Л**О**НДОН = londan = london

### How vowels change when unstressed

- О : When it is unstressed it turns to the [a] sound
  - МОЛОК**О** = malako = milk
- Е : when it is unstressed it turns into the [ih] sound
  - СЕСТР**А** - sihstra = sister
- Я : when it is unstressed it turns into the [yih] sound
  - ЯМ**А**ЙКА = yihmaika = jamaica
