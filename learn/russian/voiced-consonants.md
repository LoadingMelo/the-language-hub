## Voiced and Unvoiced Consonants

Because of the Russian language is, the way we pronounce some consonats changes, the same way as we saw with [Vowel Reduction](/russian/vowel-reduction)

### Relation Between Voiced and Unvoiced Consonants

Each voiced consonant is related to an unvoiced one. As such, how they sound when pronounced is almost similar.

| Voiced | Unvoiced |
| ------ | -------- |
| Б      | П        |
| В      | Ф        |
| Г      | К        |
| Д      | Т        |
| Ж      | Ш        |
| З      | С        |

### How They Change

Voiced consonats can become unvoiced:

1. At the end of a word:  
   ПЕТЕРБ**У**Р<u>Г</u> - pihtirburk  
   Г**А**МБУР<u>Г</u> - gamburk  
   ГОРБАЧЁ<u>В</u> - garbachef  
   МЕДВ**Е**ДЕ<u>В</u>

2. In the middle of a word when followed by an unvoiced consonant:  
   В**О**<u>ДК</u>А - votka  
   ВТ**О**РНИК - ftornik

Inversely, unvoiced consonants become voiced:
