## Nouns

Nouns in Russian are divided into three parts(genders): Masculine, Feminine and Neutuer. The way you tell the difference is through the endings.

Let's revisit the alphabet, we first need to separate the consonants from the vowels to continue with this section.

### Russian Vowels

Here are the vowels in Russian:

- А
- Е
- Ё
- И
- О
- У
- Э
- Ю
- Я

The rest are consonnats or modifiers.

### Nouns

The most obvious way to tell a noun's gender is by what it denotes.

| Masculine       | Feminine      |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| ПАПА (father)   | МАМА (mother) |
| Д**Я**ДЯ (uncle | ТЁТЯ (aunt)   |

#### The Rule

1. If a nouns end in consonnat or **Й** it is masculine
2. If it ends in **А** or **Я** it is feminine.
3. If it ends in **Е** it is neuter

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --------- | -------- | ------ |
| ctol      | mashina  | vino   |
