## Contributing

You are more than welcome to contribute to this project. As a matter of fact you are encouraged to, because at the end of the day, this is **your** project

### How to Contribute

Data rendered on the site is from markdown files located in the `learn` folder in the root of the project.

#### Adding Language Files

- Currently there are files for French and Russian.
- To add to the existing languages, either modify the exisiting file or create a new `.md` file in the appropriate folder
- To add a new language, create a folder in the `learn` directory with the language

```
├── learn
│   ├── french
│   │   ├── basics.md
│   ├── russian
│   │   ├── basic.md
│   ├── [your language]
│   │   ├── [your-file].md
```

For the `.md` files, please make sure the frontmatter matches this pattern:

```yml
---
title: ""
topic: ""
excerpt: ""
part: 01
---
```
